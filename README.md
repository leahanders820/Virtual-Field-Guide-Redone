# The Virtual Field Guide - WIP

## Description

The Virtual Field Guide is your digital explorer's journal. Make an account and have access to a map where you can learn about the flora, fauna, and landmarks of different countries. Save information you find interesting and have your own journal to take notes on new discoveries. WIP

## Technologies Used

This is a MERN stack application. It uses MongoDB and GraphQL for the server side functionality and Apollo tools, node.js and express for the middleware, and React for the front end. Other technologies used include cors, JWT, and bcrypt. 


## Usage

When the application is opened the user will be able to either log in if they have an account, or sign up. Once they have an account, they will be able to learn about the plants, animals, and landmarks of countries and regions. The user also has access to their own digital "journal", where they can save info, take notes, edit their notes, or delete them. WIP
